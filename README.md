# Occlusion-Tracker-Webcam

This project focuses on object tracking through occlusion, allowing users to view live tracking using a webcam or camera device.

It leverages Deep Learning with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and the YOLO (You Only Look Once) v8 architecture for efficient and accurate object detection.

To run this project, use the Python extension. The code generates the yolov8m.pt model, which enhances object identification, and creates a file within the existing project folder.
